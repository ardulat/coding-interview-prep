# Coding Interview Preparation Plan

This is my personal coding interview preparation plan that I hope to follow during the time frame. Many things were adopted from other interview prep guides, some were suggested by top KZ coders that I know. Everything was then customized according to my knowledge and experience. Feel free to customize it for yourself.

**Time frame**: ~6 month (mid May - mid November)


**Goal**: at least 1 offer to big tech company in Europe/US

# Background

Plan is based on existing preparation guides:

  - **[Interview preparation guide bible from Sergey Makagonov]**
  - [Good guide on GitHub]
  - [Another guide on GitHub (seems to be less powerful)]

To stay motivated during preparation:

  - [Programeme Instagram]
  - [Tushar Roy’s YouTube Channel] - suggested by Alibek Datbayev
  - [CS Dojo's YouTube Channel]
  - Find someone who is also preparing for interviews and discuss problems together - suggested by Yerzhan Mademikhanov
  - Mock interview each other - suggested by Sherzat Aitbayev


# Overview

**The areas I know:**
   - Back-end software development - Django MVC/REST, asynchronous Tornado, Play for Java, JAX-RS
   - Machine Learning - built language models with RNNs
   - iOS Development - 1 year experience (long ago, probably forgot)

   
**The areas I need to work on:**
   - **Algorithms & Data Structures (Stacks, Queues, Graphs, Trees, etc.)** - 80% of time
   - Object-Oriented Programming (in C++)
   - System Design (Scalability :smirk:)
   - Dynamic Programming
   - Computer Architecture (Cache, RAM, etc.) - *review the course at NU*
   - Operating Systems (Processes and Threads, Scheduling) - *review the course at NU*
   - Computer Networks (especially TCP/IP) - *review the course at NU*

# Plan

I have decided to split my plan into two phases (three months each): summer and fall phases.

## First phase: Summer Time

**Time to dedicate:**
   - 2 hrs on weekdays, 5 hours on weekends
   - 12 weeks
   - Total: ( 2 x 5 + 5 x 2 ) x 12 = 240 hrs (*be realistic, 200 hrs will be good too*:wink:)

**Objective:** solve > 200 problems on Leetcode! :sunglasses:

**Programming language chosen:** C++

**Areas to work on:**
   - Algorithms (e.g. sorting)
   - Data Structures (e.g. lists, stacks, queues, hash-map)
   - Graphs (e.g. BFS, DFS)
   - Trees (e.g. BST)
   - Object-Oriented Programming (in C++)
   - Dynamic Programming
   - **Mock Interviews - once a month**
   
**Where to study:**
   - [*Programming Challenges* by Steven Skiena] - first 3 chapters (theory only)
   - [LeetCode] - start from easy Facebook, LinkedIn, Uber, AirBnb, then focus on middle and hard problems
   - [InterviewBit] - go for another theory from video lectures and problems
   - [HackerRank], [Codeforces] - if time left for contests (to keep being interested in solving problems)
   - [Codefights] - suggested by Anuar Serikov
   - [Algorithm Design Canvas] - general guides on how to solve algo problems

**Comments:**
   - Push solved problems to Github for later usage to refresh memory


## Second Phase: Fall Term

**Time to dedicate:**
   - TBD but less than previous phase due to university studies

**Objective:** solve 100 more Leetcode problems! :sunglasses:

**Areas to work on:**
   - Computer Architecture (Cache, RAM, etc.)
   - Operating Systems (Processes and Threads, Scheduling)
   - Computer Networks (especially TCP/IP)
   - System Design (Scalability uuh, cool)
   - **Mock Interviews - once a week (on weekends)**
   - Keep solving [LeetCode] problems + [*Cracking the Coding Interview*]

   
**Where to study:**
   - [*Computer Organization and Design* by David Patterson]
   - [*Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach* by Jim Kurose]
   - GitHub repos mentioned above
   - **Everything listed in Sergey’s post (MUST!!!)**
   - [Pramp] - suggested by Yerzhan Mademikhanov (20 unique free interviews)
   - [Gainlo] - wanna pay?
   - [Distributed Systems] - **highly recommended** by Alibek Datbayev
   - Watch past interviews of people on [Glassdoor], [CareerCup] - suggested by Ulugbek Adilbekov

# Extra Time

Everything listed here is optional. Even though it is not that realistic to dedicate time to all these, I will try doing it during rest time at leisure :smile:

**Read Books:**
   - [*The Mythical Man-Month* by Brooks]
   - [*Inside the Black Box: The Simple Truth About Quantitative Trading*]

**Develop own website/landing page:**
   - [Yenbekbay.me] (source code is starred on Github)
   - [Sarahlim.com]

**Improve existing codes:**
   - [Software Engineering course project]
   - [Data Mining course project] - building financial models (use Siraj Raval’s example code)

**Complete started courses:**
   - [Python for Data Structures, Algorithms, and Interviews!]
   - [Machine Learning]
   
**Open Source projects to contribute:**
   - [QuantLib: the free/open-source library for quantitative finance]

**Physical:**
   - Buy a whiteboard/glassboard, put it in front of a mirror - *good investment*
